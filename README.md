# Brain-Tumor-Classification-Supervised-Learning
This repository provides an automated system for classifying brain tumor images using machine learning. It distinguishes between normal, glioma tumor, meningioma tumor, and pituitary tumor cases. The project uses supervised learning to train a Random Forest classifier and allows users to analyze external images for classification.
